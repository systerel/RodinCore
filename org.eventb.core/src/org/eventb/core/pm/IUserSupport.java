/**
 * Common protocol for manipulating the state of a proof and its proof tree.
 * <p>
 * A user support instance is associated with a Proof Status file, which is set
 * with the {@link #setInput(IPSRoot)} method. This method
 * should be called only once, and prior to any other method call (except for
 * {@link #dispose()} which can be called at any time).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once the input set, there is no proof obligation associated to a user support
 * instance yet. A proof obligation will get associated when one of the
 * following method is called:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #setCurrentPO(IPSStatus, IProgressMonitor)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #nextUndischargedPO(boolean, IProgressMonitor)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #prevUndischargedPO(boolean, IProgressMonitor)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * For the latter two, one needs in addition that there exists an undischarged
 * proof obligation in the associated proof file.
