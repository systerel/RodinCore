/**
 * Common protocol for accessing the proofs of an event-B component. This
 * interface provides a unique facade for manipulating proofs in a consistent
 * manner.
 * <p>
 * Proof components are created by calling the <code>getProofComponent</code>
 * method of the proof manager. From a proof component, one can create a new
 * proof attempt for a proof obligation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The proof related data of an event-B component are stored in three different
 * files:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the PO file contains the lemmas of the proof obligations generated for
 * the component;</li>
 * <li>the PR file contains the proofs created by the user or the auto-prover;</li>
 * <li>the PS file contains the statuses of the proof obligations, i.e., whether
 * the proofs stored in the PR file do discharge the lemmas contained in the PO
 * file.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class provides utility method that allow to manipulate both the proof
 * file and the proof status file of a proof component together.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All interactions with the Rodin database are done with a scheduling rule
 * locking these three Rodin files.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
