/**
 * Common protocol for Event-B projects. This interface groups together various
 * methods for accessing to all event-B files of a Rodin project.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface cannot be built directly. The standard way of
 * getting a handle to a Rodin project is to use the adapter factory from a
 * rodin project:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    IRodinProject rodinProject = ...;
 *    IEventBProject evbProject = rodinProject.getAdapter(IEventBProject.class);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Another method is to ask for the Event-B project of an Event-B root element:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    IEventBRoot root = ...;
 *    IEventBProject evbProject = root.getEventBProject();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
