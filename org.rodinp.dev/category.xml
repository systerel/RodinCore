   This file defines the plug-ins and features
   that should go in the org.rodinp.dev repository.
   
   It has been constructed by mimicking the contents of the Rodin product
   as defined in
   
      org.rodinp.platform.repository/org.rodinp.platform.product
      
   but adding a ".source" extension to get the corresponding source plug-ins
   and features.
   
   However, this only brings the plug-ins and features that are included.
   For the required plug-ins and features, we need to also add them here
   manually.
   
   Finally, we add the feature containing all the tests of the core Rodin
   platform together with its requiements.
