/**
 * Common protocol for describing a specialization, which groups together type
 * substitutions, free-identifier substitutions, and predicate-variable
 * substitutions in one object. It allows to specialize a formula by applying
 * all these substitutions at once.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class can be created only through a formula factory. Type,
 * free-identifier and predicate-variable substitutions are then added one by
 * one using <code>put()</code> methods. Finally, the instance is passed as
 * argument to a <code>specialize()</code> method on a type, type environment or
 * formula.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The substitutions can also change the formula factory. Consequently, all
 * substitutes must have been created with the same formula factory as this
 * specialization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These substitutions must be compatible, that is the expression to be
 * substituted for an identifier must bear a type which is the result of
 * applying the type substitutions to the type of the identifier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This condition must hold after every method call. This implies that a type
 * substitution required for a free identifier substitution should be put in the
 * specialization strictly before the considered free identifier substitution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When specializing a type, type-environment or a formula, an instance of this
 * class can change by side-effect in the following manner: For each free
 * identifier, not already part of the free identifier substitution and which
 * occurs in the specialized type, type environment or formula, a new identifier
 * substitution is added to this specialization. It maps that identifier to an
 * identifier with the same name, but bearing the type obtained by specializing
 * the type of the original identifier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For instance, if a specialization substitutes type <code>T</code> for type
 * <code>S</code> and is applied to a type environment containing free
 * identifier <code>x</code> of type <code>S</code>, then the specialization
 * will be complemented with the substitution of <code>x</code> of type
 * <code>T</code> for <code>x</code> of type <code>S</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When defining substitutions, a specialization also maintains a destination
 * type environment. It contains all the identifiers that have been used in the
 * right-hand sides of substitutions, as well as all identifiers that have
 * occurred in a formula passed to <code>specialize()</code> methods and that
 * have not been substituted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this destination type environment, together with the automatic
 * completion of substitutions ensures that successive applications of a
 * specialization to several type environments or formulas are all compatible.
 * In particular, if a formula type-checks with respect to some type
 * environment, then the specialized formula also type-checks with the
 * specialized type environment, under the condition that both specialization
 * are performed with the same instance of this class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Similarly, when specializing a formula, an instance of this class can change
 * by side-effect in the following manner: For each predicate variable, not
 * already part of the predicate variable substitution and which occurs in the
 * formula, a new predicate variable substitution is added to this
 * specialization. It maps that predicate variable to itself.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the rare cases where the side-effects are not wanted, one can always clone
 * a specialization object and use the clone to apply a specialization.
 * </p>
