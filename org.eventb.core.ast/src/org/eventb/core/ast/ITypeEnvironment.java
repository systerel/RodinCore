/**
 * Common protocol for accessing type environments.
 * <p>
 * A type environment is a map from names to their respective type. It is used
 * by the formula type-checker as both an input and output.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * More precisely, the type-checker takes as input a type environment which
 * gives the type of some names and produces as output a new inferred type
 * environment that records the types inferred from the formula.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Type environments enforce name consistency. This means that all names must be
 * valid identifier names in the associated language (as defined by the formula
 * factory used to create this type environment) and that any name that occurs
 * in a registered type (i.e., any carrier set name) is automatically added to
 * the type environment as a given set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients. Use
 * {@link FormulaFactory#makeTypeEnvironment()} to create new type environments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are two implementations of this interface. One is mutable and allows to
 * gradually build a type environment (see {@link ITypeEnvironmentBuilder}). The
 * other is immutable and stores a stable type environment (see
 * {@link ISealedTypeEnvironment}). Methods
 * {@link ITypeEnvironment#makeSnapshot()} and
 * {@link ITypeEnvironment#makeBuilder()} allow to navigate between these two
 * variants.
