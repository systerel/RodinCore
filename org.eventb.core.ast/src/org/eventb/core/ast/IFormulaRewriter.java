/**
 * Common protocol for formula rewriters. A formula rewriter implements
 * rewriting of sub-formulas of some formula. This protocol does not support
 * predicate variables. See {@link IFormulaRewriter2}.
 * <p>
 * This interface contains one method for each of the sub-classes of
 * <code>Formula</code>, except assignments which are not covered by sub-formula
 * rewriting.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rewriting must be compatible with type-checking. For each
 * <code>rewrite</code> method, if the input formula is type-checked, then the
 * returned formula must also be type-checked. Moreover, if the input formula is
 * a type-checked expression, then the returned expression must bear the same
 * mathematical type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rewriting must return nodes with the same formula factory as original nodes.
 * Formula factory modification can only be done with the
 * {@link Formula#translate(FormulaFactory)} procedure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: If a rewrite method does not make any change to a
 * sub-formula, it should return a formula identical to its input (same
 * reference). This makes it much easier for testing whether a rewriter made any
 * change to a formula.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
 * </p>
