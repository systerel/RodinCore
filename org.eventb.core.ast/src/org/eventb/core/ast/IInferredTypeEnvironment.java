/**
 * Common protocol for inferred type environments.
 * <p>
 * An inferred type environment is a map from names to their respective type and
 * a reference to the initial type environment. It is produced by the formula
 * type-checker as an output.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * More precisely, the type-checker takes as input a type environment which
 * gives the type of some names and produces as output a new inferred type
 * environment that records the types inferred from the formula.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All value access methods return only values from inferred environment and all
 * value set methods add values in inferred environment only if they do not
 * exist in the initial environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An inferred type environment cannot be translated with a given formula
 * factory. It means that calls to
 * {@link ITypeEnvironment#isTranslatable(FormulaFactory)} always return
 * <code>false</code> and calls to
 * {@link ITypeEnvironment#translate(FormulaFactory)} always raise an
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException}. If a translation is needed then build an
 * inferred type environment with a translated initial type environment or
 * extract the inferred type environment to a standard type environment and then
 * translate it.
 * </p>
