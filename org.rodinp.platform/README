This directory contains the Rodin platform,
preconfigured with the Event-B IDE,
an integrated modelling and proving environment.

To start the Event-B IDE type 
./rodin &
in a shell in Linux, and
rodin
in Windows.

In the windows version it may be necessary to extract the
font Brave Sans Mono Roman contained in the directory "fonts"
of the jar file org.eventb.ui located in the plugins directory.

Make sure you are running the Java virtual machine 1.5 or later
from Sun.

Important Note: p2.inf MUST NOT END WITH A BACKSLASH ('\')
 (a backslash followed by a new line is OK).
 Else, exported products contain no executable.
