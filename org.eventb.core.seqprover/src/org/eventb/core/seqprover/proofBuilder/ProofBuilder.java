/**
 * This class contains static methods that can be used to reconstruct proof tree
 * nodes from proof skeleton nodes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are currently three ways in which this is supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Reuse : The simplest and most efficient, but also the most quick to fail
 * way to reconstruct a proof tree node from a proof skeleton node. Only the
 * rule stored in the proof skeleton node is tried for reuse. No reasoner is
 * called. This way is guaranteed to succeed if the sequent of the open proof
 * tree node satisfies the dependencies of the proof skeleton. The only
 * exception to the above statements is when a reasoner version has changed: in
 * this case, the reuse fails.
 * <li>Replay : Each reasoner that is mentioned in the proof skeleton in
 * replayed to generate a rule to use. The rules present in the proof skeleton
 * nodes are ignored. This method can be used to re-validate proof skeletons
 * since it completely ignores stored rules.
 * <li>Rebuild : A mixture between reuse and replay. Reuse is performed when
 * possible, and if not, replay is tried. In addition, replay hints are taken
 * into account and generated to be used in subsequent replays in order to
 * support refactoring.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The methods in this class should not be used directly, but should be used in
 * their tactic-wrapped form.
 * </p>
